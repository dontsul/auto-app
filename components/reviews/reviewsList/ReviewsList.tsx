Also, enjoy the Burj view while you eat. I ordered👇🏻\nMargarita Pizza: Believe me, the best margarita I had in Dubai. Right amount of tomato sauce, basil, cheese & base cooked to perfection. A must try 👅\n🥤Blue Lagoon Mojito: This was such a refreshing drink & exactly how I like it. So so good.\nHot Chocolate: Creamy, rich & yummy hot chocolate topped with whipped cream. Wish it’s bit sweet.\nEverything is priced reasonably and the staff are polite & sweet. Also Free parking available right behind their food truck.",

    text: "I loved this place!\nThe only down thing is that it’s too hot outside still. But once the weather in Dubai gets better, this is the place to be! 😍\nSuper cute display for our iced tea. The Diavola pizza was amazing. (Quite spicy) I love spicy but for the ones who don’t, be aware.\nLet’s not talk about the mozzarella truffle bites. WOW 😍 I looooved it!! Tried the coconut gelato as well and we all were speechless.\nWe went quite late, around 11pm we were there. It was such a nice vibe and the music. First we heard nice early 2000s songs, then some nice afro jam and then the bachata playlist came on. 😄 other people started to come around midnight and I started to teach my friend some bachata moves.\nIt was just an amazing overall experience. Will definitely come back once the weather cools down!",

    text: "Such a cute little truck serving some of the best pizzas I’ve had! So flavourful and done just right. The price is pretty reasonable for the size of the pizzas. Highly recommend the Diavola if you like slightly spicy! Also the service was quick and the location is perfect. Really enjoyed today’s fun trip to jumeriah beach where the truck is parked these days!",
